# keepass-webdav-git
python minimal webdav support with keepass auto-versionning.

The following minimal flask server is only planned to have a [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) sync working with WebDAV -the default one-. At the end of the synchronisation, the new uploaded keepass is commited in the local git directory.
